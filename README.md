### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Achivments(my code example):
From fresh to old
##### âš¡1 - https://github.com/DaniilsLoputevs/vacancy_applier
my fresh pride - the program automatically responds to vacancies, everything itself, invented, implemented, debugged.
Now it works only with HH.ru, plans to make, indeed, LinkedIn + launch not only from IDEA, but through the GUI on Kotlin Jetpack Compose and other improvements. A project with potential.
##### âš¡2 - https://github.com/DaniilsLoputevs/med_keeper
My pet project with a claim in the future will appear in the Play Market - an application for Android, a convenient storage of documents on the user's phone. When you carry a folder of physical documents with you, it's easy to lose / get something - it's convenient when everything is in the phone, however, storing and manipulating files on the phone as it is in a box is not very convenient, but if everything were divided into folders / categories - it was very suitable.
at least 4 people said it was Fire and the idea that they would use it for trips to stores, storage sorting honey. docks, etc.
* project at the initial stage of development
##### âš¡3 - is a Java class file for a pretty printout of a collection of objects. (you can compute a file in any project that can be used for logging/debugging/formatting collections of objects)
code:
https://github.com/DaniilsLoputevs/notes_java/blob/main/src/main/java/tools/PrintTable.java
tests/examples of use:
https://github.com/DaniilsLoputevs/notes_java/blob/main/src/test/java/tools/PrintTableTest.java
very convenient to use it.
##### âš¡ 4 - https://github.com/DaniilsLoputevs/expression-calculator
calculator of simple mathematical expressions or just a calculator - but not stupid as in the course 2 + 2, more real
<br>input: 2+(3*4-5+(6+4)+(10-7*2))-5
<br>output: 10
<br>because I wrote what I wanted to do, such an obsession, I see the goal, I see no barriers
* not quite a presentable view and did not expect anyone to watch it at all.
##### âš¡ 5 - Zookeeper Master (ZKM)
back-end - https://github.com/Tiunchik/zkmaster_back (written by me)
front-end - https://github.com/Tiunchik/zkmaster_front (wrote by friend Maxim)
admin panel for human control of the state of several ZooKeeper server at once
* ZooKeeper - a server program that stores the config in the form of a tree, similar to a database.
GUI through the front, displaying 2 or more complete trees that are on several servers, comparing trees, copy / cut and paste a sub-tree from one tree (server) to another and a tree (server) and another. (It was a long time ago, all the chips I donâ€™t remember, all advanced features are missing from the box at all (naked API for ZooKeepr))
- at the end of the project, the admin panel was used by a friend's colleagues at his place of work - feedback is a very useful thing, especially comparing several trees (configs) at once. You can compare the configuration of several circuits on one screen without dancing and a tambourine.
